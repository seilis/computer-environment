# Linux Computer Environment Files
Storage and versions of my preferred environment files when working on Linux systems.

## How to use
My recommended method of use is to take a look through the configuration files,
which are stored in the [config](config) directory and copy them to your home
directory as appropriate. You are free to copy and modify the files as per the
[license](LICENSE).

There is also a [Makefile](Makefile), which will install all of the files. I
don't recommend this unless you happen to know that you want all of your
configuration replaced with mine.

## Contents
* abcde - [.abcde.conf](config/.vimrc)
* beets - [config.yaml](config/.config/beets/config.yaml)
* gVIM - [.vimrc](config/.vimrc)
* Zsh - [.zshrc](config/.zshrc)
